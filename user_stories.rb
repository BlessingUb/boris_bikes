# Write down the type of error

# Write down the file path where the error happened

# 3: from /Users/faryahussain/.rvm/rubies/ruby-3.0.0/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/irb-1.3.0/exe/irb:11:in `<top (required)>'

# Write down the line number of the error

# Use the Ruby Documentation to find out what the error means
# You'll see this error when the code refers to a class or module that it can't find, often because the code doesn't include require, which instructs the Ruby file to load the class.
# In Ruby, variables/methods begin with lowercase letters, while classes begin with uppercase letters. If the code doesn't reflect this distinction, you'll receive the Uninitialized Constant exception.



# Suggest one way of solving the error.
# - issue is because we don't have class - so either create a class, or link to a class
